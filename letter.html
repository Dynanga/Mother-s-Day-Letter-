    <h1>Dear [Calli],</h1>
    
    <p> Hello, my love. Guess what? It's Mother's Day!
     And here I am, writing this letter for you, 
     because for me, you deserve this more than anyone else. 
     A mother is not just for women who have children; a mother is just like you, 
     who takes care of everyone around you, especially your siblings. 
     I know you've been through a lot because of them, so enjoy this day, okay?
     Take a break; this day is for someone who's as good a mother as you. Happy Mother's Day, baby! 
     You deserve to be greeted and loved. The flowers along with this message are for you,
     my two favorite things in this world. Happy Mother's Day, and I love you so much.


Love you most,
[Dianamor]
